# Collection Highlights

Here's a really neat image:

{% include feature/image.html objectid="coll001" %}

![Image I'm sharing with you](/objects/coll001.jpeg)

![Image I'm sharing with you no first slash](objects/coll001.jpeg)


Let's try again:
![Image with a better description]("https://github.com/gabrielesh/yokai-senjafuda-01/blob/main/objects/coll001.jpeg")


Here it is with size specified:

<img src="/objects/coll001.jpeg" alt="first image in collection" width="200"/>

trying again:

<img src="https://github.com/gabrielesh/yokai-senjafuda-01/blob/main/objects/coll001.jpeg" alt="first image in collection" width="200"/>
